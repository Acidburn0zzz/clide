    <description>The only contract provided by this assembly is the IAdapter interface. This is the interface that 
            the adapter service implementation interacts with. As such, the SDK does not have any other 
            external dependencies, since it's the adapter service that consumes this interface. The client-facing 
            code does not need to know about adapters either.
            
            ======= Example =======
            public class ProjectToMsBuildAdapter : IAdapter&lt;IProject, IMSBuildProject&gt;
            {
                // Implement actual conversion.
            }</description>
